        <img src="assets/your-image.jpg" alt="Your Description" class="portfolio-bg-image">

                <p>Your description</p>
                <a href="your-link" target="_blank" class="portfolio-link">
                    <i class="your-icon"></i>

    </div>
</div>
```

2. **Add your image** to the `assets/` folder
3. **Update the filter buttons** if needed

### Changing Image Effects
You can modify the CSS in `styles.css` to change how images behave:

```css
/* Different hover effects */
.portfolio-item:hover .portfolio-bg-image {
    transform: scale(1.1); /* More zoom */
    filter: brightness(0.8); /* Darker on hover */
}

/* Different image positioning */
.portfolio-bg-image {
    object-position: top; /* Focus on top of image */
    object-position: center; /* Center focus (default) */
    object-position: bottom; /* Focus on bottom */
}
```

## üì± Responsive Considerations

The images will automatically:
- **Scale properly** on different screen sizes
